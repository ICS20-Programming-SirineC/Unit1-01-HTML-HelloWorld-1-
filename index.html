    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Sirine Cherkaoui, and I am a grade 10 student at         
Immaculata High School. During this semester, one of my courses is        computer programming (ICS2O), and my teacher is Mrs. Raffin. We are        currently working on unit 1, and we have started our first     assignment, which consists of creating a webpage. Specifically, in this webpage, we are expected to discuss our favorite pass-times as well as our favorite subjects. Enjoy the reading! </p> 
  <h3>My favourite pass-times: Reading</h3>
  <font size="3">  <p> My favourite pass-time is reading text-books about  scientific subjects such as psychology. Textbooks are my favorite types of books since they organize information in a clear and thorough way as well as they ease the progress of comprehension since they contain a variety of illustrations, scientific facts, graphs and terminology.  On the other hand, reading about psychology  and psychologists such as Abraham Maslow, Sigmun Freud, and Ivan Pavlov really interests me, as it deepens my knowledge of my behavior, emotions and ideas. Furthermore, it makes me understand why people act the way they do. Currently, I am studying Pavlov's classical conditioning, which has had a huge impact on the understanding of human behavior.</p>

  <h3> My favorite subject: Math </h3>
  <p> My favorite subject in school is math in view of the fact that I am fascinated with all abstract knowledge resulting from logical reasoning and critical thinking. In addition, math is my favorite subject in school because of its countless uses in everyday situations, and how it challenges myself and others to solve complex problems.  To illustrate, math is essential  when baking to ensure that the ingredients are properly measured out, otherwise, the end result will not be close to what is expected. Moreover, without mathematics, it would be impossible to shop,  take out a mortgage on a home, balance a budget, or complete countless other everyday tasks. Finally, my proficiency in math has developed my critical-thinking and, most importantly, my confidence because there is nothing more rewarding than the sense of accomplishment acquired when understanding a challenging and advanced math concept and applying it in everyday life. </p>
